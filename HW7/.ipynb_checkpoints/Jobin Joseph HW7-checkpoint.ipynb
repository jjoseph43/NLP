    "In this assignment I used two kmeans clustering  to be able to cluster together the different  words in the  reviews and have similar reviews join into a cluster. In the  first model the K has been set to 8, which will then produce 8 different centroids. The first cluster is about superheroes  and Disney  that occur in the movie reviews. The second one  had a positive  or negative notation in reviews. The third on seemed to be about movies that  have a  lasting effect on the audience. The fourth cluster was hard to interpret . The fifth cluster is about  movies that are centered around holidays and how that makes sense as there are comedy’s that are about holidays. The sixth cluster is about  movie reviews with other characters that come up during the film and that usually these movies are rentals. The seventh  about  movies that are centered around a character  there is even a character such as zorro that comes up. Lastly  the eight cluster is about  some sub genres in comedy such as parody.\n",

The last one is a centroid that came up similar to  the k means k 8 example this is about and some actors that might have played in them.\n"
